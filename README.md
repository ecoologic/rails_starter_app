# APP

A blank app.

## Install

Depends on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

    docker-compose build web && docker-compose up web
    docker-container bin/rails db:setup

## Run specs

    docker-container run web bin/rspec

## Debug

    docker-container ls
    docker-container [container_id_web_app] attach

## Known issues

###### Permissions on the host machine

Files that are generated by Docker will be owned by root on the host.
Temporary workaround:

    host$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
